{"input": "the experiments at 17.5â mK on the millikelvin NMR spectrometer described in Refs.â 4, 24, 25, which employed a 3Heâ4He dilution refrigerator and a superconducting magnet with a variable field strength of up to 15â T; we applied between 2.0 and 3.0â T. The NMR probe was tuned to a fixed frequency of 104.5â MHz, which corresponded to an approximate Larmor frequency of 1H at 2.5â T. The pulse sequences used herein are shown in Figureâ 1. The magnetic field was kept constant during the entire duration of the saturation recovery experiments. The saturation sequence always consisted of 500â pulses of 2.5â Î¼s at 18â W. For the conventional pulse experiments (Figureâ 1âa) used to monitor the recovery, 1â Î¼s pulses at an rf power of 22â W were used. Due to the long relaxation times and frequent changes of the magnetic field, no exact pulse calibration was performed. Avoiding exact pulse angle calibration could be seen as an added advantage of spin noise based methods. Saturation recovery experiments with spin noise detection were performed analogously to the procedure introduced in Ref.â 8 using the sequence in Figureâ 1âb for the monitoring of the extremely slow magnetization buildup pertinent here. To prevent pickâup of rf signals through the transmitter cable and circuit acting as an antenna, the transmitter cable was manually disconnected from the probe after the saturation pulse train and two 50â Î© terminators were attached to avoid open connectors. Disconnecting the transmit channel was not a requirement for the experiment as such, but was a precaution required in the particular setup and environment. By using optimal spectrometer hardware and in an rfâquiet environment (in particular, devoid of radio stations working in the respective frequency range), the connection could be left in place. The delay, Ï 0, required for this task and for starting the monitoring experiment was short (<1â min) relative to the relaxation times involved and the same for pulse and spin noise experiments, and thus, was negligible in the calculation of the time coordinates of the buildup curves. During the whole spin noise detected experiment, noise blocks of 1536 data points each were acquired with a spectral width of about 2.86â MHz, resulting in a duration of 0.26â ms per noise block. Each block was Fourier transformed and the power spectrum was calculated. A total of 16â k power spectra (corresponding to a period of 20â min of recovery time each) were then combined. To eliminate constant noise contributions from the spectrometer and environment, we subtracted a background noise power spectrum obtained by noise acquisition in an identical manner, except for the NMR Larmor frequency being set offâresonance by changing the magnetic field to 3.00â T. (Notably, since that frequency was also offâresonance with respect to the rfâcoil's resonance frequency, no spin noise signal was obtained.) A fifthâorder polynomial baseline correction was applied before final integration of the peaks. The resulting negative [due to the intrinsic properties of spin noise, see Eq.â (2)] integral values were", "output": [], "instruction": "I want you extract semantic triples using the following predicates (the definition for each predicate has been defined in the corresponding parentheses):\n\n                                            1) Environmental processes (A series of events that occur naturally in the environment and not within an organism)\n                                            2) Biological processes (Biological or chemical events or a series thereof, leading to a known function or end-product within an organism)\n                                            3) Industrial processes (A series of molecular events that involve at least one synthetic reaction)\n                                            4) Adverse biological roles (The biological function of a chemical that results in harmful effect for an organism.

{"input": "which authorizes a health claim for those olive oils that contain at least a minimum concentration of endogenous “polyphenols” active for “the protection of blood lipids from oxidative stress”. No method was specifically suggested or adopted in the regulation for the measurement of the 5 mg of hydroxytyrosol and derivatives (e.g., oleuropein complex and tyrosol) per 20 g oil. This gap, together with some disagreements among scientists and authorities on which individual compounds among the numerous (more than 30) known olive oil phenolics [8] should be summed up, led the olive oil sector to limit the implementation of this claim, to avoid legal implications [9,10].Technically speaking, there are hundreds of publications on the analysis of olive oil phenolic compounds, the most important of which are oleuropein and ligstroside derivatives, but no fully validated procedures are available so far, to our knowledge. The findings of these papers are frequently reviewed and critically discussed [11,12,13,14,15]. These compounds are mainly determined in the PF of the oil by liquid chromatography, capillary electrophoresis and gas chromatography, though they can be also determined in the intact oil. Among them, the IOC had adopted in 2009 [16] a procedure that is articulated by a PF extraction step, a separation protocol, ultraviolet (UV) detection at 280 nm and a rather ambiguous quantification approach. Soon after the health claim was issued, the IOC recognized the need for the development of a “fit for purpose” method suitable for addressing the analytical requirements in an open call [17]. Toward this direction some research groups published papers in peer review journals presenting more or less sophisticated approaches [18,19,20,21,22,23,24]. Most of them involve hydrolysis of the bound forms of Htyr and Tyr, and calculation of their total content in the free form after separation on a liquid or gas chromatographic column using diode array or flame ionization detection systems, respectively, because these are widely available in official and quality control laboratories [18,19,20,23,24]. The two most promising hydrolysis protocols used in these publications have been developed to address other issues long before the launching of the regulation. The one published by Mulinacci et al. [25] deals with hydrolysis of the bound forms in the polar extract of the oil, whereas the one by Romero and Brenes [26] deals with their hydrolysis directly in the oil. Some previous discussions pointed out the advantages of the first protocol [19]. In brief, analysis of phenolic compounds before and after hydrolysis in the PF provides multiple types of information that are otherwise lost. Moreover, hydrolysis is completed faster in the PF than in the intact oil by a factor of 3 times and generates less waste. In the present work, ultra-high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) is selected as a green and faster means for phenolic compounds separation, to speed up overall analysis time. This choice is in line with current trends in liquid chromatographic applications in the food sector [27]. Detection at 280 nm is adequate because only Htyr and Tyr are determined.

{"input": "the skin barrier protein filaggrin might be involved in the pathophysiology of IV, no genetic defect had been identified to confirm or disconfirm this until some 20Â years later. The reason behind this lack of progress stems from the structure of this highly complicated protein and the very unusual gene that encodes it.2 The name filaggrin is a contraction of âfilament aggregating proteinâ. The protein was originally identified and named by Beverly Dale in Seattle as an insoluble protein that binds keratin proteins.3, 4 Cell culture experiments showed that fluorescentlyâlabelled filaggrin is able to decorate keratin intermediate filaments4 and in addition, inÂ vitro experiments showed that filaggin causes bundling and condensation of these filaments.5 Immunohistochemistry, immunoâelectron microscopy and further biochemical studies revealed that the precursor of filaggrin, a giant (>400Â kDa) protein known as profilaggrin, is the main constituent of the keratohyalin granules that mark out the granular layer of the epidermis.2 The fact that these granules are visible by lowâpower light microscopy in H&Eâstained skin sections is evidence that profilaggrin/filaggrin is a very highly abundant protein in the outermost layers of the epidermis. Molecular cloning of fragments of the profilaggrin mRNA and gene revealed that this encodes multiple copies of the 37Â kDa filaggrin protein. Human profilaggrin consists of 10â12 nearâidentical repeats of the filaggrin monomer connected by short cleavable linkers â somewhat resembling a string of sausages (Fig.Â 1). Figure 1 Schematic of the human profilaggrin/filaggrin gene (FLG) showing the very unusual intronâexon organisation (top), colourâcoded to show of this encodes the profilaggrin protein domains (bottom). The repetitive nature of this gene and protein impeded identification of the very common FLG mutations for some decades. Figure 2 Filaggrin deficiency correlates with eczema risk. People carrying two FLG null mutations express zero filaggrin protein in their epidermis (bottom panel) and have a massive odds ratio of >Â 150, meaning that essentially all of these individuals get eczema. Heterozygous carriers of a null mutation have about 50% of the normal amount of filaggrin in their skin and have a high risk (8Â ÃÂ ) of developing eczema. Finally, even within the soâcalled normal population, there is a Â±Â 10% variation in the amount of filaggrin produced (due to a subtle type of sequence variation). People expressing about 90% of the normal amount of filaggrin have a small but significant eczema risk. In contrast, people expressing more than the average amount of filaggrin in their epidermis (110%), show a 40% protection from eczema (odds ratio 0Â·6). Thus, there is a strong correlation between the degree of genetically determined filaggrin deficency and the likelihood of developing eczema.

{"input": "overlying vitritis. Laboratory diagnosis of toxoplasmosis traditionally relies on the presence of IgM antibodies or on IgG seroconversion. However, in immunocompromised patients, seroconversion may be delayed and even absent. The specificity and sensitivity of PCR is, therefore, particularly useful 3. Primary prophylaxis for the prevention of toxoplasmosis is used by many heart transplant centers. Some advocate indefinite prophylaxis in donorârecipient mismatch. For other solid organ transplant programs, especially in the presence of a low background rate of Toxoplasma IgG seropositivity in the population, and where TMP/SMX Pneumocystis jirovecii prophylaxis is routine, donors and recipients are not routinely tested for the presence of evidence of past Toxoplasma infection 15. Little experience has been published on the need for secondary prophylaxis after completing a treatment course for a confirmed Toxoplasma infection in the context of immunosuppression outside the HIV/AIDS population 17. Further studies are warranted given the side effect profile and costs associated with agents such as TMP/SMX; regular monitoring by blood PCR may be an alternative strategy. In summary, we present a case of toxoplasmosis chorioretinitis in a liver transplant recipient. This is the first such case, to our knowledge, reported after prophylaxis, and we believe that it is likely to represent graft transmission. The onset months after transplantation, the relative rarity of the condition, and its atypical presentation may delay diagnosis in similar cases. We note the utility of parallel donorârecipient serology and of PCR analysis of aqueous fluid. Toxoplasma infection is still a potential risk for the liver transplant population despite widespread use of TMP/SMX prophylaxis.

The purity of proteins was assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and the protein concentration was assayed with Bradford method48.Activity assay of HpaBCThe HpaC activity was assayed at 37 °C by monitoring the absorbance decrease at 340 nm which was corresponding to the concentration variation of NADH, in the absence of HpaB49.For HpaB activity determination, the reaction mixture containing 0.1 mM FAD, 1 mM NADH, 0.1 mL of purified HpaC and 0.5 mL of purified HpaB wild-type or mutant enzyme in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) was incubated at 37 °C. The reaction was started by adding 5 mM of the indicated substrate (4-HPA, tyrosine, tyrosol or tyramine), and stopped with 5% (v/v) acetic acid after 1 h. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min, and the supernatant was quantified by HPLC. One unit of HpaB activity was defined as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 1 mM of the corresponding substrate per minute under the conditions described above49.Homology modelingThe three dimension structure of HpaB of E. coli was generated by Modeler 9.20 using HpaB from (4OO2) and (2YYJ) as templates24,25,50. Mutants were manually substituted native amino acid with desired sequences in Coot51, and followed with a loop refinement by Modeller 9.20 due to its high flexibility. Protein structure generated from each model process for wild type and mutants were submitted to SAVE v5.0 (http://servicesn.mbi.ucla.edu/SAVES/) server for assessment, and the model with the highest overall quality factor and Ramachandran plot were chosen as final models. The final models were further optimized by energy minimization with Gromacs 96 force field in Gromacs-5.0.752. The binding model of 4-HPA, tyrosol, tyramine to wild type or mutant HpaBs were calculated by Autodock Vina53, binding energies were used to estimate the affinities of substrates.Reporting summaryFurther information on experimental design is available in the Nature Research Reporting Summary linked to this article.Supplementary information Supplementary Information Peer Review File Reporting Summary Source Data References: Metabolic engineering for plant natural product biosynthesis in microbes Metabolic engineering of antibiotic factories: new tools for antibiotic production in actinomycetes Improving key enzyme activity in phenylpropanoid pathway with a designed biosensor Overexpression of Coptis japonica norcoclaurine 6-O-methyltransferase overcomes the rate-limiting step in benzylisoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis in cultured Eschscholzia californica Design and application of a mevalonate-responsive regulatory protein Programming cells by multiplex genome engineering and accelerated evolution Cofactor self-sufficient whole-cell biocatalysts for the production of 2-phenylethanol Specificity and promiscuity at the branch point in gentamicin biosynthesis Methyltransferases of gentamicin biosynthesis Delineation of three pathways of glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthesis in Leishmania mexicana.

{"input": "this goal. One problem arises from strong radiation damping (RD) in the NMR circuit caused by large nuclear magnetization coupled to the feedback field of the radiofrequency (rf) coil.6 As a consequence, the spectral line shapes may be heavily distorted, which interferes with quantitative interpretation.7 In addition, uniform rf excitation over the entire spectral width is virtually impossible due to the large spectral line widths that are characteristic for static lowâtemperature solidâstate NMR spectra. For these two main reasons, the quantitative evaluation of the line shapes in pulsed NMR spectra of supercooled samples is highly problematic (see the Supporting Information). However, high RD rates, Î»R0 , also enable the use of an alternative detection method: spin noise detection.8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 Observation of dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP)âderived nuclear hyperpolarization through spin noise was achieved both after dissolution15 and more recently in situ.16 Because spin noise detection avoids the conversion of large longitudinal magnetization to transverse magnetization by rf pulses, there is no need to measure offâresonance to avoid RDârelated lineâshape artifacts. As a further benefit, spin noise data are intrinsically free from any perturbations by rfâpulse imperfections and interference. Herein, we demonstrate spin noise detection as an alternative way of monitoring the very slow buildup of nuclear spin polarization of a sample in an ultralow temperature cryostat. The nuclear spin noise signal integral is related to the total longitudinal spin polarization by the current RD rate. 2 âTheory RD is a major source of complexity in NMR spectroscopy experiments on highly polarized samples. The origin of RD lies in the nature of the rfâprobe circuits used in NMR spectroscopy experiments.6 Any transverse magnetization induces a current in the receiver coil, which is normally detected as the free induction decay (FID). The same current also causes a magnetic feedback field (the RD field), which acts on the spins in turn, tilting the longitudinal magnetization away from the magnetic field axis, and thus, generating transverse magnetization. The rfâfield generated by this secondary transverse magnetization interferes with the original transverse signal in a complex way, depending on the phase shift of the feedback field.17, 18 Pronounced effects of RD are, for example, increased resonance line widths, line shapes that are, even for small flip angle spectra, no longer Lorentzian and may exhibit âwigglesâ in the case of larger tipping angles.7 Although these effects are alleviated somewhat by fast transverse relaxation, they heavily interfere with quantitative interpretation. For all NMR spectroscopy experiments with strong nuclear magnetization in resonant circuits, RD needs to be considered. The RD rate, Î»R0 , is a measure for its impact, which is defined by Equationâ (1):6 (1) Î»R0=12Î·Î¼0Î³Mz0Q in which Î· is the filling factor,Î¼0 is the vacuum magnetic permeability, Î³ is the gyromagnetic ratio, Mz0 is the thermal equilibrium magnetization, and Q is the quality factor of the rf circuit.

Analytical MethodThroughout the bioconversion time, samples (1 mL) were withdrawn periodically (every 2 hours or less depending on the progress of the reaction) and centrifuged at 8000×g for 10 min. The supernatant was analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the concentration of the different metabolites. The instrument consisted of a Shimadzu C-R6A liquid chromatograph coupled to a Shimadzu SPD-6A UV detector. The separation was carried out on a C18 reverse phase column (250 mm×4.6 mm; 5 μm particle size; Shim-pack VP-ODS). The mobile phase consisted of (A) 0.1% formic acid in water and (B) 70% acetonitrile in water. The following gradient was used: 0 min 10% B, 25 min 25% B, 35 min 80% B, 37 min 100% B, 40 min 100% B, and 50 min 10% B. The flow rate was set at 0.7 mL/min. The injection volume was 20 μL. The eluted compounds were detected at λ 280 nm and identified by comparison with authentic standards.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Predictive Model of Hydroxytyrosol ProductionWe previously studied the bioconversion of tyrosol into hydroxytyrosol in Erlenmeyer flasks [16]. In the present work, we are focusing on the scale-up of the reaction into laboratory fermenters. In order to examine the hydroxytyrosol production (mM), two independent variables, biomass and tyrosol concentrations, were investigated using a response surface methodology. The biomass and tyrosol concentrations were varied in the ranges of 2.5 to 5 g (wet weight)/L and 4 to 6 g/L (28.9 to 43.4 mM), respectively. These two variables were investigated through the use of a central composite design. The experimental design generated 18 experiments among which only 16 runs were considered and the two others were discarded due to an excessive lengthening of the reaction time (Table 1). For all of the sixteen experiments, reaction time ranged between 18 and 27 hours. However, for experiments 17 and 18, reaction times lasted for more than 50 hours. Table 1 shows that the highest hydroxytyrosol production was obtained at 5 g/L biomass and 6 g/L tyrosol (experiment N° 2). Under these working concentrations, the molar bioconversion yield was brought to 86.11% with 37.39 mM hydroxytyrosol production. A representative time course evolution of the bioconversion reaction is given in Figure 1.The analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the lack of fit of the predictive model are shown (Table 2). Analysis was based on p values as a criterion in order to check the significance of the model [20, 21]. The model F-value of 117.235 associated with a p value <0.0001 implies that the model is highly significant. In fact, this probability denotes that the noise error is less than 0.01%. Another marker of the goodness of our model is the regression coefficient R2. A coefficient R2 = 0.983 indicates that only 1.7% of the experimental data cannot be explained by the predicted model (Figure 2).

{"input": "Overall, the full EVOO hydrophilic phenolic profile was proven to be better resolved when using the Kinetex biphenyl column.2.2. Resolution Parameters ComparisonTable 1 shows the resolution parameters that are tested for the three studied columns. The Kinetex biphenyl column showed a better performance in all the considered parameters than the other two columns for the tested peak pairs, leading to an increase in peak capacity factor (nc) of 31% and 35%, in relation to the LiChrospher and the Spherisorb columns, respectively. Commonly, an increase in peak capacity was achieved, increasing the stationary phase length. Donato et al. [30] described an increase of about 37% on the peak capacity when duplicating the column length. Since the gradient time was constant, the variable applied was the peak width, which was directly related to the efficiency. Therefore, it was possible to maximize the efficiency, and consequently the peak capacity, using the Kinetex biphenyl column. This decrease is similar to those that are generally achieved with higher stationary phase lengths.Concerning the selectivity (α), which may be seen as the ability to distinguish between the analytes, according to Table 2, the best results for both peak pairs were obtained with the Kinetex biphenyl column. Special attention should be paid to the separation of OAIa and OAIb, where a selectivity of 1.0 (no separation at all) was observed when using the Spherisorb column (Figure 3C). Clearly, for these two peaks, a huge selectivity improvement was obtained when applying the Kinetex biphenyl column.Differences in selectivity are determined by various interactions between the column stationary phase and the solute. There are several mechanisms that play an important role in column selectivity, such as hydrophobicity, hydrogen bonding, dipole–dipole, and ion exchange. Another important contributing factor for selectivity are the π–π interactions, which occur between the analyte and the stationary phases. These interactions involve the presence of aromatic rings, which in this case, are present in the biphenyl phase of the Kinetex column, and they can successfully be explored in the separation of closely related compounds, like metabolites or degradation products [31], which is in agreement with our results showing that selectivity increased when the biphenyl-phase column was used.The retention factor (k) of HT was determined for the three tested columns. The Kinetex biphenyl column presented the best performance, with an overall retention time reduction of 22.1% (Table 2). Theoretically, for a particular substance, in this case, HT, the k factor will vary depending on the pressure used (by changing flow rate),the nature of the stationary phase, the composition of the solvent, and the temperature of the column. Since only the stationary phase was changed, the better k value observed for the Kinetex biphenyl column was due to the specific characteristics of these superficially porous particles. In this case, these particles are based on a solid core surrounded by a thin porous shell, in contrast with the fully porous particles presented on the ODS-based columns, which offer a shorter diffusion path within the working porous shell, improving the mass transfer", "output": [], "instruction": "I want you extract semantic triples using the following predicates (the definition for each predicate has been defined in the corresponding parentheses):\n\n                                            1) Environmental processes (A series of events that occur naturally in the environment and not within an organism)\n                                            2) Biological processes (Biological or chemical events or a series thereof, leading to a known function or end-product within an organism)\n                                            3) Industrial processes (A series of molecular events that involve at least one synthetic reaction)\n                                            4) Adverse biological roles (The biological function of a chemical that results in harmful effect for an organism.

He says, “They don't look like the normal antibiotic, so that's why I think they're fairly unique.” The basic research was done under a grant from the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the United States Department of Defense's (DOD) central research and development organization, and once the researchers realized they wanted to develop drugs against three agents that have been considered bioterrorism threats — Brucella, tularensis, and anthrax — they established a separate operation, Anacor Pharmaceuticals, which is developing them with DOD funding and without Shapiro. In her Stanford lab, she continues her fundamental research to define the complete genetic circuitry of Caulobacter, hoping to identify additional nodes in the circuit. She says, “I am not doing it to develop antibiotics; that's what comes out of the work. My goal is to understand how the cell works. I think a lot of studies in pathogenesis should not be just to understand pathogenic organisms, but to understand the complete network of regulatory mechanisms that controls the bacterial cell.”Phage TherapyThe most radical approach to new antibiotics may be the resurrection of an old idea: bacteriophage therapy (see Figure 2). Late in the 19th century, a researcher noticed that water from some of India's sacred rivers combated cholera. Some years later, the active agents were identified as viruses that infected bacteria. Such viruses are called bacteriophage, or phage for short. There were reports of phage success against dysentery, typhoid, and plague, and bacteriophage therapy had a brief heyday, especially in the 1920s. Results on other diseases were mixed, and with the appearance of antibiotics, phage therapy became unfashionable in the United States, although it has continued in Russia and Eastern Europe.Figure 2PhageNegative stain electron micrograph of the gamma phage from which the PlyG lytic enzyme was cloned for use to control B. anthracis. (Photograph courtesy of Vincent Fischetti and Raymond Schuch, The Rockefeller University.)Phage were the model organisms of choice for genetics research in the 1930s and 1940s, but became less fashionable as research tools when investigators moved on to eukaryotes. A few held on, like Ry Young of Texas A&M University, who has made phage-induced cell lysis his life's work. “The cell is basically genetically dead as soon as the phage goes in there, but it will keep living as sort of an infected zombie for as long as the phage wants it to, with virus particles accumulating inside the cell,” he explains. “Only when the phage is ready and has decided that it's the right time will it pull the trigger. And the cell blows up.” The freed phage then spew forth to infect new cells.Antibiotic resistance has led to new interest in phage therapy by several small biotech companies.

{"input": "= 0). In the B. subtilis model, there are four boundary conditions: T 20, T 02, T 11, and T 00. Furthermore, the methylated receptors T 11 and unmethylated receptors T 00 are partially active. We needed, therefore, to distinguish additional states to construct a robust model involving activity-dependent methylation. In a similar manner to the E. coli model, we assume that the kinetics for ligand binding are fast and employ the quasi-steady-state assumption for simplicity. The probabilities αij(L) and iij(L) are given by the expressions with these parameters: α20 = 1; α10 = 0.4, α11 = 0.2; α00 = α01 = α02 = 0; α0 20 = 1; α0 10 = 0.99, α0 11 = 0.8; α0 00 = α0 01 = α0 02 = 0; i 02 = 1; i 01 = 0.99, i 11 = 0.8; i 00 = i 10 = i 20 = 0; i 0 02 = 1; i 0 01 = 0.4, i 0 11 = 0.2; i 0 00 = i 0 10 = i 0 20 = 0; β = 0.2; β0 = 0.8; KL = 10 μM. The parameters were inferred from tethering experiments, where the attractant asparagine is added and then removed in a flowcell containing wild-type cells and the rotation of the flagellar motor is observed (Kirby et al. 1999) The model assumes that CheY negatively regulates CheA activity. The model assumes that only phosphorylated CheY (Yp) binds receptors. We model receptor binding with the following two differential equations: where [T] and [TYp] denote, respectively, the concentration of unbound and Yp-bound receptors. We assume that the fraction of active receptor complexes CA satisfies the following differential equation: where kA = 0.5 [T](1 + 10TA + 0.1TWA) and kI = 0.5 [TYp](2 + 10TI + 0.1TWI). The term C denotes the concentration of inactive receptor complexes. Evident from the expressions for kA and kI, weakly active and inactive receptors contribute less to the state of the receptor complex. The model for the phosphorylation cascade in B. subtilis is an extension of the model proposed for E. coli. The key differences are the addition of CheV and the loss of CheZ. We used a Michaelis–Menten-type expression to model inhibition of the CheA kinase by unphosphorylated CheV (V). There is no dedicated phosphatase for CheY in B. subtilis. However, the motor switch appears to enhance the CheY dephosphorylation when phosphorylated CheY is bound to the motor (Szurmant et al. 2003). We assume the rate of CheY dephosphorylation increases when phosphorylated CheY is bound to the motor: As we lack kinetic parameters for B. subtilis, we used the parameters from the E. coli model when available. The parameters for CheV and CheY dephosphorylation were chosen so that the dynamics of the model were similar to those observed in tethering experiments involving wild-type bacteria and cheBCDR mutants (Kirby et al. 1999). For simplicity, we used Michaelis–Menten kinetics to model the methylation reactions. Similar results were obtained using mass action kinetics.

The procedure was in house validated [28] and is proposed to the olive oil sector as a reliable fit for purpose method in line with guidelines recommended by Eurachem [29] and other relevant method standardization bodies.2. Results and Discussion2.1. Analytical ProtocolThe overall analytical procedure involves: (i) PF extraction in line with the IOC [2]; (ii) hydrolysis of an aliquot of PF in accordance with Mulinacci et al. [25] as adopted by Mastralexi et al. [19]; and (iii) determination of Htyr and Tyr in the PF prior and after hydrolysis as described by Mastralexi et al. [19]. Extraction solvent, methanol:water, 80:20, v/v, was standardized in our previous work [30]. In this work parameters like dilution of oil in hexane or not and the effect of ultrasound bath technical characteristics are clarified. As shown in Table 1, oil dilution did not significantly influence the total phenol amount determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu (F-C) assay as equivalents of caffeic acid (CA), or the individual total Htyr and Tyr content determined by high performance liquid chromatography coupled to diode array detector (HPLC-DAD). The same was shown for the ultrasound technical characteristics (data not shown), which is recommended to be referred in the documents upon application.Paiva-Martins and Gordon [31] examined the stability of certain olive and olive oil phenolic compounds (0.6 mM each component) in a ethanol:water 65:35, v/v solution at pH 3.5, 5.5 and 7.4 and found no loss for Htyr after storage for 48 h (37 °C, in the dark). Zafra et al. [32] examined the effect of freezing, refrigerating or room temperature to the stability of Htyr aqueous solutions (2.5, 25, 250 mg/L) prepared in Milli-Q water for a week and suggested storage under freezing conditions to avoid any degradation. Under the conditions (acidic pH, 80 °C, 2 h) applied by Mulinacci et al. [25], in the absence of the lipid matrix, Htyr was reported as stable, a finding also verified by Mastralexi et al. [19] at a similar concentration level. In the present study, the stability of Htyr in the presence of the lipid matrix under the above conditions was examined and discussed in § 2.2.2.The UHPLC protocol validated herein had as its starting point the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) protocol proposed by the IOC as it was scaled down by Schneider [33]. Adjustments/modifications were then carried out for its adaptation to laboratory facilities. The column selected was recommended by the chromatographic system manufacturers as the type with the highest-pressure tolerance (100 MPa) among the array of available long (75 × 2.0 mm) columns commercialized by them and suitable for applications involving mobile phases with high water content [34]. The column is end-capped, with a high surface area of 500 m2/g, a carbon load of 22%; chemically stable at pH 2–7.5. The particle size was 1.6 μm, which is below the maximum limit (2 μm) proposed for UHPLC applications [35].

No therapeutic intervention has been found to alter disease progression but several drugs are currently being developed and tested (Bates etÂ al. 2015). The progression of HD is slow, with half of the patients surviving at least 24Â years after the motor diagnosis (Rodrigues etÂ al. 2014). This makes studying the efficacy of diseaseâmodifying compounds challenging. The development of sensitive biomarkers of disease progression that reflect neuropathology and treatment response is of vital importance to empower clinical trials. Tau is a protein with microtubuleâstabilizing functions, which is mainly confined to axons, and when abnormally assembled or aggregated, is associated with multiple neurodegenerative conditions, Alzheimer's disease in particular (Spillantini and Goedert 2013). Indeed, it has been shown that tau concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with Alzheimer's disease is associated with disease progression (Blom etÂ al. 2009). It has been shown that HD patients have higher CSF total tau concentrations compared with healthy controls (Constantinescu etÂ al. 2011), but no associations with phenotype or independent validation were made. Recently, two independent groups showed that human HD, while principally a âhuntingtinopathyâ, was also in effect a secondary tauopathy, with tau isoform imbalances, increased total tau, nuclear tau deposits, and tau coâlocalization with mHTT (FernandezâNogales etÂ al. 2014; Vuono etÂ al. 2015). Given all this, we set out to study whether CSF total tau is a biomarker of disease progression.

Preparation of Standard SolutionsStandard stock solutions of Htyr and Tyr at a concentration of 500 mg/L (low concentration range) and 1000 mg/L (intermediate to high concentration range) were prepared in methanol:water 1:1, v/v. Aliquots were further diluted with the same solvent mixture to prepare a series of calibration working solutions for each analyte in the range 0.5–100 µg/mL. Stock solutions were kept in dark volumetric flasks at −18 °C and warmed up to room temperature before use. Working solutions were prepared daily.3.5. Sample Preparation3.5.1. Extraction of the Polar Fraction (PF)VOO PF was prepared as described in the IOC protocol [16] without the addition of internal standard. In brief, 2.0 g of VOO were accurately weighted in a 10 mL screw-cap tube (15 mL). Then, 1 mL of methanol:water, 80:20 v/v was transferred to the previously weighed sample. The tube was sealed and the sample was vortexed for exactly 30 s. Then, 5 mL of methanol:water, 80:20 v/v were added and the sample was further vortexed for exactly 1 min. Extraction was carried out in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min at room temperature. After centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 25 min the supernatant phase was collected. Extraction was carried out in triplicate (unless otherwise stated). The isolated PFs were combined into a representative one, which was filtered through 0.22 µm PVDF membrane before injected onto the chromatograph.3.5.2. Acidic HydrolysisThe procedure of Mulinacci et al. [25] as adopted by Mastralexi et al. [19] was followed. In brief, an aliquot (200 μL) of PF was mixed with 200 μL of a 1 M H2SO4 solution.

{"input": "not yet been fully established.This study was designed to investigate the role of ARNO in the regulation of PLD activity by insulin in HIRcB cells, a Rat-1 fibroblast cell line that overexpresses human insulin receptors. The objectives were: 1) to test if insulin induces the translocation of wild type ARNO to the plasma membrane in transiently transfected HIRcB cells; 2) to determine whether ARNO translocation is accompanied by activation and subcellular translocation of ARF; 3) to explore if overexpression of wild type ARNO in HIRcB cells alters insulin-dependent PLD activity; and 4) to investigate the function of individual domains of ARNO in insulin-dependent PLD and ARF activation.ResultsInsulin–dependent binding of ARNO to cell membranesThe translocation of ARNO and ARNO mutants to the membranes was studied in HIRcB cells using a digitonin permeabilization assay. For these experiments, HIRcB cells were transiently transfected with myc-tagged wild type ARNO and the following mutants: ΔPH-ARNO, PH-ARNO, ΔCC-ARNO, CC-ARNO, E156K-ARNO and R280D-ARNO. This assay is based on the formation of pores in the plasma membrane induced by digitonin to allow cytosolic proteins to leak out of treated cells upon centrifugation. Fig. 2 shows that, after digitonin permeablization, a significant fraction of ARNO proteins leaked out of serum-starved HIRcB cells that transiently overexpressed the wild type ARNO and its mutants. Since these proteins were mostly recovered from the supernatant fractions, suggesting that wild type ARNO and the mutants tested are predominantly cytosolic in non-stimulated cells. In contrast, when digitonin permeablization was performed in the presence of insulin (100 nM), most of wt-ARNO, E156K-ARNO, and ΔCC-ARNO as well as a part of CC-ARNO were recovered from the particulate membrane fraction, suggesting that these ARNO proteins can be recruited to the membrane by insulin to various degrees. However, neither R280D-ARNO nor ΔPH-ARNO was recovered from the particulate fraction after insulin stimulation, suggesting that the translocation of ARNO to the membrane requires an intact PH-domain. It should be noted that, although the CC domain alone binds to the membranes under stimulation conditions, the degree of the binding is much less than that of wild type ARNO (Fig. 2). Surprisingly, a construct containing only the PH domain of ARNO could not be recruited to the membranes by insulin, indicating that the PH domain is essential but not sufficient for the translocation of ARNO.Figure 2Insulin promotes the translocation of ARNO to cell membranes. HIRcB cells were transfected with myc-wt-ARNO, myc-E156K-ARNO, myc-R280D-ARNO, myc-ΔPH-ARNO, EGFP-PH-ARNO, EGFP-ΔCC-ARNO, and CC-ARNO-EGFP. The cells were treated with/without (Control) 10 μM digitonin (Dig). Where indicated, 100 nM insulin, 1 mM ATP, and 100 μM GTPγS were present during permeablization reaction. Pellets and supernatants were separated by centrifugation and the presence of myc-ARNO and its mutants or ARNO-EGFP in each fraction was determined by immunoblotting.ARNO recruits ARF1 to the plasma membrane in an insulin-dependent mannerSince ARNO is an activation factor of ARF, we tested the hypothesis that agonist-dependent ARNO translocation facilitates the local binding of ARF proteins to the membrane.

These facts pose particular challenges for the measurement of NMR spectra and spin relaxation phenomena. Nuclear spin noise spectroscopy is used to monitor proton spin polarization buildup to thermal equilibrium of a mixture of glycerol, water, and copper oxide nanoparticles at 17.5â mK in a static magnetic field of 2.5â T. Relaxation times determined in such a way are essentially free from perturbations caused by excitation radiofrequency pulses, radiation damping, and insufficient excitation bandwidth. The experimental spinâlattice relaxation times determined on resonance by saturation recovery with spin noise detection are consistently longer than those determined by using pulse excitation. These longer values are in better accordance with the expected field dependence trend than those obtained by onâresonance experiments with pulsed excitation. magnetic propertiesnanoparticlesNMR spectroscopyradiation dampingspin relaxationAustrian Science FundFWF I1115-N19European UnionECOST-STSM-TD1103-091114-048672 source-schema-version-number2.0component-idcphc201600323cover-dateOctober 5, 2016details-of-publishers-convertorConverter:WILEY_ML3GV2_TO_NLMPMC version:4.9.4 mode:remove_FC converted:06.10.2016 M.

This effect has been exploited as an alternative means of generating nuclear hyperpolarization, even at room temperature by using the âbruteâforceâ approach.1, 2 It is critical for this approach to achieve high polarization levels within reasonably short time spans. Nuclear spin polarization buildup is a longitudinal relaxation process characterized by a relaxation time constant T 1, which is âastronomicallyâ slow (i.e. in the order of magnitude of 107â s) below 1â K.3 Nanoparticles have been shown to have a huge effect in accelerating spin polarization buildup at very low temperatures.4, 5 These preceding studies demonstrated that the presence of metallic nanoparticles, for example, 30â nm platinum or copper, could reduce the T 1 relaxation times by several orders of magnitude at ultralow temperatures. This finding opens up the possibility of using high magnetic field and low temperature to grow significant polarization in a reasonable timescale, and thereby, encourage the development of a bruteâforce polarizer. The development of improved protocols for bruteâforce polarization requires the slow buildup of large nuclear spin polarization at low temperatures to be monitored.

{"input": "imperfect response rate, and individuals with missing data. In all, our results suggest an association between passive smoking and ETD in children. Further investigation of longitudinal cohorts would provide greater insight into the long-term consequences of prolonged smoke exposure on eustachian tube function, especially as passive smokers age into adolescence and adulthood. Opportunities for future study include establishing a more defined relationship between environmental tobacco smoke exposure and ETD. Presently, it is unknown what cumulative dose of tobacco smoke exposure is required to produce negative middle ear pressures and subsequently ETD. Moreover, given recent insights into the possible underlying mechanism of ETD caused by smoke exposure, it may be clinically relevant to identify children that may be at a greater risk for developing ETD at lower dosages of smoke exposure, such as those predisposed to allergies and atopic disease.

{"input": "the PKS that accounts for this gamut of structural variation.During the 1990s, the ability to manipulate actinomycete genes, developed over previous decades, mainly using the model species Streptomyces coelicolor (Hopwood 1999), was combined with chemical and biochemical experiments to begin to crack this ‘polyketide code’. The first studies were on organisms making antibiotics of the ‘aromatic’ family, which includes tetracycline and doxorubicin, as well as the model compounds actinorhodin (made by S. coelicolor itself) and tetracenomycin. The main variable in their structure is carbon chain length, with few choices of different building units or keto group modification, so the programming would (in principle) be simple. The DNA sequences responsible for such PKSs revealed sets of genes encoding proteins, including ketosynthases, ketoreductases, and acyl carrier proteins (ACPs) (the unit of the PKS on which the growing carbon chain is tethered; see Figure 1A), that would come together to form a multicomponent PKS resembling a typical bacterial fatty acid synthase. In contrast, the DNA sequence of the gene set for the complex polyketide erythromycin, made by a relative of Streptomyces called Saccharopolyspora erythraea, which has more involved programming, revealed multifunctional proteins with the various enzymic functions carried out by active sites on the same polypeptide chain, as in a mammalian fatty acid synthase.The big surprise, though, was the finding of six sets, or modules, of such active sites, corresponding to the six rounds of condensation needed to build the carbon chain (Cortes et al. 1990; Donadio et al. 1991). The modules each contain an acyl transferase (to load the extender unit onto the enzyme), as well as a ketosynthase and an ACP domain, together with exactly those reductive activities needed to generate the required pattern of modification of the chain at each step of elongation. Thus was born an ‘assembly line’ model in which the program for the PKS is hardwired into the DNA and expressed in a linear array of active sites (domains) along the giant protein. This consists of the six chain-building modules, preceded by a short module for loading the starter unit and ending in a domain for releasing the completed carbon chain from the PKS. The carbon chain of the polyketide would be assembled and modified progressively as the molecule moved along the protein, interacting with each domain in turn, which would select extender units, make carbon–carbon bonds, and modify keto groups as appropriate, depending on the presence or absence of domains for the three steps in the reductive cycle.The model arose from the gene sequence, but was rapidly tested by mutating individual domains or adding or deleting whole modules and by observing predicted changes in the polyketide product. Soon, dozens of engineered compounds had been made, and the field mushroomed with the isolation of more and more clusters of genes for complex polyketides that both proved the generality of the model (with minor variations) and filled the need for spare parts for the engineering of countless new polyketides (Shen 2003). Several biotech companies were founded to exploit", "output": [["tetracenomycin", "Industrial applications", "antibiotic"], ["tetracycline", "Industrial applications", "antibiotic"], ["doxorubicin", "Industrial applications", "antibiotic"], ["actinorhodin", "Industrial applications", "antibiotic"]], "instruction": "I want you extract semantic triples using the following predicates (the definition for each predicate has been defined in the corresponding parentheses):\n\n                                            1) Environmental processes (A series of events that occur naturally in the environment and not within an organism)\n                                            2) Biological processes (Biological or chemical events or a series thereof, leading to a known function or end-product within an organism)\n                                            3) Industrial processes (A series of molecular events that involve at least one synthetic reaction)\n                                            4) Adverse biological roles (The biological function of a chemical that results in harmful effect for an organism.

{"input": "HpaBC mutants showed some catalytic activity towards 4-HPA, which was however lower than that of the wild-type enzyme. Mutant D11 showed high specificity towards tyramine, and its activities on tyrosol and 4-HPA were 8% and 13%, respectively, of that on tyramine. All mutants showed little activity on tyrosine.To understand the substrate specificities of the HpaB mutants, molecular models were generated (Fig. 4). Mutant A10 displayed a high activity for tyrosol, and its docking energy for tyrosol was also found to be much lower than that for wild-type HpaB. The hydroxyl group at the tail of tyrosol forms a hydrogen bond with nitrogen atom on main chain of T210, and the side chain of T210 and L211 provide hydrophobic interactions to facilitate substrate binding. The negatively charged side chain of E212 is likely to make bond to side chain of R474, maintaining the loop conformation for tyrosol binding (Fig. 4b).Mutant D11 displayed a high catalytic activity using tyramine as a substrate. Similar as wild-type HpaB, the hydroxyl head of tyramine is hold by three catalytic residues, which reserves the catalytic activity of HpaB. The distance from substrate to FAD is 4.3 Å. The amine group of tyramine was hydrogen bound with side chain of Y212 and main chain of S462 (Fig. 4c). The binding energy of tyrosol to mutant D11 is a little lower than that of tyramine, and the hydroxyl group at the tail of tyrosol has ability to hydrogen bond with Y212 and S462. However, the hydroxyl group in the side chain of Y212 could be negatively charged in the physical condition, it will prefer the amine tail of tyramine which is likely to be positively charged. Introduction of tyrosine residues could be critical for recognition of tyramine, we also observed the tyrosine substitution at position 212 in mutant B7 (S210T, A211P, Q212Y) which preferred tyramine as a substrate (Fig. 3f).Mutant H7 displayed a dramatically higher catalytic activity on both tyrosol and tyramine, and the docking energy is also found to decrease greatly compared with those for wild-type HpaB, suggesting a significant increase in affinity of H7 for both tyrosol and tyramine. Compared with A10, introduction of M211 and G212 in H7 is likely to increase flexibility of the loop, which will allow entrance of either tyrosol or tyramine. In the docking models, both tyrosol and tyramine are hydrogen bounded with oxygen atom from FAD (Fig. 4d, e). Moreover, hydroxyl of tyrosol can be also coordinated by side chain of T210, and main chains of G209 and M211 (Fig. 4d). Notably, the distance from substrate to FAD decreased to 4.1 Å, which may also enhance the catalytic efficiency of H7 for tyrosol and tyramine.DiscussionDiversity is necessary for evolutionary adaptation, which influences the survival of populations under environmental variations28–30. For example, at the molecular level, the same reaction can be catalyzed by enzymes with totally different primary sequences31,32.

{"input": "specificity, linearity, detection limit and limit of quantification, accuracy, precision, robustness and applicability.Specificity of the method for the fluorescent target analytes (Htyr, Tyr) was tested using the peak purity function of the diode array detector after analysis of VOO PFs prior to and after acidic hydrolysis.Linearity of the calibration curves was examined in the concentration range of 0.05–100 for Htyr and 0.05–140 μg/mL for Tyr. Each of the eight concentrations used was analyzed in quintuplicate [29]. Calibration curves were constructed on three consecutive days using the least squares method [49]. After fitting the data, the residuals plots were examined for possible patterns. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was also carried out and the values of the SS and MS for both the regression and the residuals were examined, along with the F and F significance values (better known as p value) to establish a strong linear relationship [38].For the standard compounds, the limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ) were calculated as 3.3 × sB/b and 10 × sB/b, respectively [45], where b is the slope of the curve and sB corresponds to sy/x = SQRT[Σi(yi − ŷi)2/(n−2) − 1], where yi is the experimental value and ŷi the predicted one from the calibration curve [50]. To determine the LOD and LOQ values, and in order to avoid the influence of the high concentrations, linear curves based on low levels of both analytes (0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4 and 0.8 μg/mL) were constructed [51]. Each standard solution was injected 5 times.The precision of the method was tested as follows. Standard solutions of both Htyr and Tyr in the concentration range 0.5–100 μg/mL were measured 5 times intra-day and analyzed on three consecutive days aiming to evaluate the repeatability of the measurement (% relative standard deviation, %RSD). The repeatability of the method was then examined via analysis of the PFs of three VOOs using the F-C assay [19]. The samples were measured 5 times intra-day and also analyzed on three consecutive days. In addition, aliquots of ROO spiked with varying concentrations of both analytes (5 replicates) were analyzed in triplicate intra-day and on three consecutive days. The spiked levels used were 1.0, 1.5 and 2.5 mg/20 g oil for Htyr and 1.5, 3.5 and 5 mg/20 g oil so that the samples analyzed to contain a total amount of 2.5, 5.0 and 7.5 mg/20 g oil. The relative ratio of the two analytes was selected according to information provided by Tsimidou et al. [10].Accuracy of the method was examined by recovery experiments. More specifically, a set of PFs obtained from ROO aliquots spiked with the target analytes (5 replicates, 3 concentration levels, see previous paragraph) were chromatographed prior and after acidic hydrolysis in triplicate. The examination was made intra-day and on three consecutive days. In addition, a VOO containing mainly bound forms of the analytes (total Htyr, 0.48 mg/20 g oil; total Tyr, 0.83 mg/20 g oil), was spiked with the target analytes at one concentration level (Htyr: 1.5 mg/20 g oil, Tyr:", "output": [], "instruction": "I want you extract semantic triples using the following predicates (the definition for each predicate has been defined in the corresponding parentheses):\n\n                                            1) Environmental processes (A series of events that occur naturally in the environment and not within an organism)\n                                            2) Biological processes (Biological or chemical events or a series thereof, leading to a known function or end-product within an organism)\n                                            3) Industrial processes (A series of molecular events that involve at least one synthetic reaction)\n                                            4) Adverse biological roles (The biological function of a chemical that results in harmful effect for an organism.

(○,□) Receptors were immunoprecipitated in the absence of insulin from cells transfected with empty vector (○) or with myc-ARNO (□). (●,■) Receptors were immunoprecipitated in the presence of insulin from cells transfected with empty vector (●) or with myc-ARNO (■).We then transfected HIRcB cells with myc-tagged ARNO constructs. Fig. 5 shows that the wild type ARNO co-immunoprecipitated with the insulin receptor in an insulin-dependent manner. E156K-ARNO was also co-immunoprecipitated with the insulin receptor upon insulin stimulation. However, none of the deletion mutants, including ΔPH-ARNO, PH-ARNO, ΔCC-ARNO, and CC-ARNO, as well as a site-directed mutant R280D-ARNO, was found co-immunoprecipitated with the insulin receptor. These data suggest that ARNO directly interacts with the insulin receptor and that the interaction requires intact PH and CC domains, but the catalytic activity of the Sec7 domain does not alter the interaction.Figure 5Immunoprecipitation of the insulin receptor with ARNO and its mutants. Immunoprecipitated proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and myc-ARNO, myc-E156K-ARNO, myc-R280D-ARNO and myc-ΔPH-ARNO were detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal anti-myc epitope antibody. PH-ARNO-EGFP, ΔCC-ARNO-EGFP, and CC-ARNO-EGFP were detected by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody against EGFP.Effects of the overexpression of ARNO or its mutants on insulin-dependent PLD activityWe have shown so far that ARNO mediates the translocation of ARF proteins to the plasma membrane with insulin stimulation. Since ARF proteins mediate the activation of PLD by insulin [23], we tested the hypothesis that ARNO may play a role in the regulation of PLD activitiy upon insulin stimulation. To prove this point, the PLD activity of HIRcB cells that had been transiently transfected with the wild type ARNO, and mutant ARNO constructs.Fig. 6 shows that the overexpression of the wild type ARNO significantly increased insulin-induced PLD activity when compared with that of non-transfected cells. In contrast, the overexpression of the indicated ARNO mutants significantly decreased the ability of insulin to stimulate PLD. We conclude, therefore, that members of the cytohesin/ARNO family of ARF GEFs play an important role in the regulation of PLD activity by insulin.Figure 6Effects of overexpression of the wild type and mutant ARNO constructs on the activation of phospholipase D by insulin. HIRcB cells were trans fected with empty vector, myc-wt-ARNO, myc-E156K-ARNO, myc-R280D-ARNO, and myc-ΔPH ARNO, PH-ARNO-EGFP, ΔCC-ARNO-EGFP, and CC-ARNO-EGFP. PLD activity was determined by a transphosphatidylation assay as described in Materials and Methods.DiscussionSeveral studies have demonstrated that ARF proteins may mediate receptor-dependent activation of PLD. Stimulation of cell surface receptors with agonists, such as insulin, promotes the translocation of ARF proteins to the cell membranes and the activation of ARF proteins and the subsequent activation of PLD [16, 18, 21, 23]. However, the mechanisms by which ARF proteins are activated by cell surface receptors remain obscure.ARF GEFs of the cytohesin/ARNO family have been shown to be recruited to cell membranes by mechanisms that are influenced by extracellular agonists [7, 26]. These GEFs have been implicated in the regulation of many cellular processes, ranging", "output": [], "instruction": "I want you extract semantic triples using the following predicates (the definition for each predicate has been defined in the corresponding parentheses):\n\n                                            1) Environmental processes (A series of events that occur naturally in the environment and not within an organism)\n                                            2) Biological processes (Biological or chemical events or a series thereof, leading to a known function or end-product within an organism)\n                                            3) Industrial processes (A series of molecular events that involve at least one synthetic reaction)\n                                            4) Adverse biological roles (The biological function of a chemical that results in harmful effect for an organism.

{"input": "in order to maintain back pressure values within the acceptable working range of the instrument and safeguard column performance. Sample injection was set at 3 μL (2.5-fold higher than that calculated using the ThermoFisher HPLC method transfer calculator [36]) to increase the sensitivity, without observing peak splitting. Autosampler temperature was maintained at 6 °C to assure stability of the analytes in the extracts/solutions analyzed in replicate.To examine the separation efficiency of UHPLC, the same virgin olive oil (VOO) PF fraction was also analyzed using the aforementioned IOC HPLC protocol [16]. The recorded profiles were compared and it was shown that UHPLC provided a similar type of separation (Figure 1) within 1/3 of the time needed to use HPLC.Elution of Htyr and Tyr was achieved in less than 5 min. Taking into account environmental concerns, the mobile phase consumption was reduced almost 6-fold for the same piece of information. As a result, 48 complete runs can be achieved within 24 h using this UHPLC protocol, whereas using HPLC the number is only 17.Because only the two analytes are quantified after hydrolysis, the quantification approach proposed by Mastralexi et al. [19] was adopted for the determination of total Htyr and Tyr content. As a consequence, the Htyr and Tyr amount corresponding to their bound forms is first calculated and then a correction factor (Htyr, 2.2; Tyr, 2.5) is used to account for the mass difference.2.2. Method Validation2.2.1. SpecificityResolution between the two peaks corresponding to the target analytes, Htyr and Tyr, was >>1 (~3.63). Peak purity determination using the diode array detector (DAD) showed that a single analyte could be assigned to each peak in the VOO PF before and after hydrolysis. This was further verified by matching the corresponding spectra to those of pure standards analyzed under the same conditions. Coupling to a fluorescence detector (FLD) under appropriate conditions of excitation showed two single fluorescent peaks assigned to the target analytes.2.2.2. Stability of the AnalytesStability of Standard SolutionsStock standard solutions of 1000 mg/L of Htyr and Tyr, respectively, were prepared in methanol:water, 50:50, v/v and stored at −18 °C for a period of one year. On four separate occasions, the stock solutions were warmed up to room temperature and working solutions of 20 and 80 mg/L (Htyr), 60 and 80 mg/L (Tyr) were prepared and measured. The percentage relative standard deviation (%RSD) values for Htyr analyzed at these two concentrations were 10.1 and 3.8%, whereas for Tyr were 6.5 and 2.8%, respectively.Stability of Htyr and Tyr in working solutions of 10, 20 and 40 mg/L—prepared by dilution from the stock solution—was examined on four different days within a week. On the basis of the recorded areas, the %RSD values were 4, 1 and 1% (Htyr) and 4, 1 and 2% (Tyr), respectively, suggesting that the solutions were stable.

Individual with infectious, inflammatory, or other concomitant CNS disorders or significant comorbidities were excluded. Healthy controls were defined as individuals without family history of HD and without symptoms compatible with HD, or without a cytosineâadenineâguanine (CAG)âexpanded allele of the HD gene. Asymptomatic gene expansion carriers were defined as individuals with a CAGâexpanded allele of the HD gene and with a diagnostic confidence level inferior to 4. Symptomatic gene expansion carriers were defined as individuals with a CAGâexpanded allele of the HD gene and with a diagnostic confidence level of 4 (Reilmann etÂ al. 2014). Clinical assessment All participants underwent a collection of demographic and clinical data as well as Unified HD Rating Scale â99 (UHDRS) (Huntington's disease study group 1996), assessed by an experienced neurologist. Age, gender, CAG repeat length of gene expansion carriers, disease stage (Bates etÂ al. 2014), total functional capacity (Shoulson and Fahn 1979) (TFC), and total motor score (Huntington's disease study group 1996) (TMS) were recorded. The UHDRS cognitive tasks (Symbolâdigit modality test, Stroop color matching task, Stroop word matching task, and Stroop interference task) were also recorded in the Vancouver cohort (Huntington's disease study group 1996). Disease burden was calculated according to CAG repeat number and age (Penney etÂ al. 1997). Patients with motor abnormalities were defined as having early, moderate, or advanced disease using the TFC scale (13â7, early; 6â4, moderate; 3â0, advanced) assessed by experienced clinical raters (Bates etÂ al. 2014). CSF sample collection and storage CSF was obtained by lumbar puncture performed between 9Â :Â 00 and 11Â :Â 00 am after fasting from midnight (water was permitted), examined by microscopy, and centrifuged to remove cells, and the acellular portion was frozen at â80Â°C. Further details were as previously published (Wild etÂ al. 2015). Hemoglobin concentration using multiwavelength spectrophotometric readings was assessed to determine CSF contamination by blood. CSF total tau quantification CSF total tau was quantified using the INNOTEST enzymeâlinked immunosorbent assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Fujirebio, Ghent, Belgium) in one round of experiments using one batch of reagents by boardâcertified laboratory technicians who were blinded to clinical data. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed with Stata version 14 software (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). Potentially confounding demographic variables (age and gender) were examined in preliminary analyses. Total tau distribution was tested for normality using skewness and kurtosis, ShapiroâWilk and ShapiroâFrancia tests. Comparisons between two groups adjusted for covariates were tested using ancova. To study the association of total tau with disease progression, we calculated Pearson's and partial correlations coefficients. Bootstrapping with 1000 repetitions was applied to nonânormal variables. Significance level was defined as pÂ <Â 0.05.

{"input": "via standard methodology at the DHMC Microbiology Laboratory and within the guidelines of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation [4]. In all cases, the throat swab was obtained immediately prior to the bronchoscopy. A subset of subjects (n = 12) also had a spontaneously expectorated sputum sample obtained for culture on the same day and prior to the bronchoscopy. To assess for contamination of BAL fluid by oral flora, in a subset of subjects (n = 3) a scope was with normal saline was performed before the bronchoscope was inserted past the vocal cord. In 2 subjects, standard culture revealed only ânormal oral floraâ in the scope wash and did not demonstrate a predominant organism. In the third subject, no bacteria were isolated from the scope wash. These data suggest that the culture results obtained in BAL fluid do not reflect contamination of the bronchoscope by oral flora. We calculated specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of throat culture results for the two most common CF pathogens as identified by Cystic Fibrosis Foundation registry data using BAL culture results as the gold standard. Comparing sputum to BAL for P. aeruginosa, we found a sensitivity of 78%, specificity of 100%, PPV of 100%, and NPV of 60%. For S. aureus found in sputum versus BAL we calculated a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 63%, PPV of 57%, and NPV of 100%. Analyzing throat swab P. aeruginosa compared to BAL, we found a 46% sensitivity, and 100% specificity yielding a PPV of 100% and NPV of 50%. Throat swab compared to BAL for S. aureus showed a sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 23%, PPV of 41%, and NPV of 100%. We calculated the phi coefficient to measure the degree of association between BAL and throat culture, BAL and sputum culture or throat and sputum culture for both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus (Fig 1). A phi coefficient above 0.7 signifies a strong positive association, between 0.7 and 0.3 indicates a weak positive association and below 0.3 suggests little or no association. The correlations between P. aeruginosa BAL and sputum culture and throat and sputum culture as well as S. aureus throat and sputum culture were statistically significant as determined by Fisherâs Exact Test (p < 0.05). Meanwhile, the correlations between S. aureus BAL and sputum culture and BAL and throat cultures for both pathogens failed to reach statistical significance. 10.1371/journal.pone.0164232.g001Fig 1 Comparison of Methods for Determining Bacterial Colonization. Clinical samples were obtained from CF subjects (n = 20 for BAL and throat swab and n = 12 for sputum). The phi coefficient was used to measure the degree of association between positive and negative cultures for P. aeruginosa and S. aureus in BAL fluid, sputum and throat swabs. Throat swabs and sputum were significantly correlated for both pathogens, as were BAL fluid and sputum for P. aeruginosa (p < 0.05 as determined with Fisherâs Exact Test and indicated by an asterisk).

{"input": "the left eye developed over several days. The patient had been well in the intervening period, with no other symptoms, and she was afebrile. External ocular examination was unremarkable. Fundoscopy of the left eye revealed 2 foci of chorioretinitis: an active nasal lesion and a temporal lesion that had largely progressed to chorioretinal atrophy. An overlying vitreous hazing was consistent with mild vitritis (Fig.Â 1). Figure 1 Wideâfield photograph of patient's left fundus, with eyelash artifacts inferiorly. Nasal region (left of the printed image) contains an active focus of chorioretinitis; the temporal region contains a region ofÂ chorioretinitis that has progressed to atrophy. Mild hazing caused by vitritis. As the differential diagnosis included Toxoplasma or CMV chorioretinitis, empirical therapy with ganciclovir and clindamycin was commenced initially. An aqueous humor sample revealed the presence of leukocytes, but routine microbiological cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for CMV and varicella zoster virus were negative. Toxoplasma gondii DNA was detected by realâtime PCR amplification of a region of the RE gene (GenBank Accession no. AF146527). Serum Toxoplasma immunoglobulin (Ig)M was positive and IgG negative; IgG became weakly positive 20Â days later. Retrospective testing of stored preâtransplant recipient serum showed absence of antiâToxoplasma IgG and IgM, whereas donor serology was Toxoplasma IgG positive. Ganciclovir was discontinued, the patient completed a course of clindamycin, and her vision normalized over several weeks. Subsequently, testing for a sporozoiteâspecific antibody, according to the method described by Hill etÂ al. 4, was negative (antiâTgERP O.D. 0.198; positive cutoff >0.4). Longâterm TMP/SMX secondary prophylaxis was commenced to prevent future recurrences, although was subsequently withdrawn because of myelosuppression. The patient went on to have a successful pregnancy while taking only tacrolimus and prednisolone immunosuppression. On review of possible risk factors for acquiring toxoplasmosis, it was established that the patient had been given and followed routine advice to wash vegetables and to cook meat thoroughly. She had contact with her mother's healthy adult cat, but did not provide care for it. Discussion This is the first reported case, to our knowledge, of Toxoplasma chorioretinitis occurring after liver transplantation despite TMP/SMX prophylaxis. Donorârecipient Toxoplasma serological mismatch (seropositive donor to seronegative recipients; D+Râ), the onset of symptoms occurring 4Â months after discontinuing prophylaxis, the absence of sporozoiteâspecific antibody, and the lack of other obvious routes of acquisition suggest that our case could represent donorâacquired infection. Of particular interest in suggesting the route of acquisition is the negative sporozoiteâspecific antibody. In contrast, in a large US series of congenital toxoplasmosis, positive results of this assay suggested that the majority of such cases represent oocyst ingestion, even in the absence of risk behaviors 5. Toxoplasma donorârecipient mismatch was a significant risk factor for post solid organ transplant toxoplasmosis across multiple solid organ types in a caseâcontrol series 6. The rate of infection appeared to be highest with heart transplantation, and this has been attributed to the Toxoplasma bradyzoite cysts' predilection for muscle tissue including myocardium 7.

{"input": "disease risk increase [3]. Different serum cytokine profiles in distinct clinical profiles of hepatitis A have been described [1]. MPV levels may reflect the cytokine levels and the inflammatory process in hepatitis A. To the best of our knowledge, MPV values have not been previously assessed in patients with hepatitis A. We aimed to investigate the MPV values in patients with hepatitis A at an early stage of illness and recovery phase and compared results with healthy control subjects. Methods Study population Data of all children who were hospitalized with diagnosis of hepatitis A in Konya Training and Research Hospital Pediatrics Clinic between January 2012 and January 2013 were retrospectively reviewed. These patients had required hospitalization because of severe nausea and vomiting. The patients were considered eligible for participation if the clinical case definition of hepatitis A of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is âan acute illness with discrete onset of symptoms and either jaundice or elevated serum aminotransferase levels and a positive immunoglobulin M antibody to HAV (anti-HAV) serologic resultâ, was met [9]. Patients with any other infectious disease or chronic disease including hematologic and hepatic diseases were not enrolled into the study. The following data were collected by using the computerized patient database: complete blood count including white blood cell (WBC), platelet counts, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), MPV, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and bilirubin, at the time of diagnosis and 2Â weeks after admission. A total of 62 children with hepatitis A and 62 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were enrolled in the study. The healthy subjects were children who applied to hospital for routine check-up. Control group subjects were recruited from hospital records of these children. Children with any sign of infection or systemic illness were excluded from the control group. The laboratory parameters of the healthy children were recorded from the same computerized database. The complete blood count analyses were performed in the same Coulter analyzer (Sysmex XE-2100, Sysmex Corporation, Kobe, Japan) in the central laboratory of our institution. Standard tubes with constant amount of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid were used. Standard liver function tests (ALT, AST) and bilirubin levels were measured with an auto analyzer. Anti-HAV was analyzed by a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay method. Statistical analysis Data were reported as meanâÂ±âstandard deviation. If not normally distributed, parameters were presented as median (minimum-maximum). The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to check the distribution of parameters. Differences in the means of variables were evaluated using both parametric and nonparametric tests depending on the distribution of the variables. Paired samples t test or Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare groups. Paired samples t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare values of the patients with hepatitis A, on admission and 2Â weeks after admission.

{"input": "from the regulation of cell motility [27] to cell adhesion [28] and, more recently, oncogenesis [29]. It has been speculated that PLD activation may mediate several of the cellular events regulated by cytohesin/ARNO GEFs [30]. However, a direct proof of a role for these factors in the regulation of the receptor-mediated PLD activation is still lacking. To address these and other related issues, we have studied in detail some of the mechanistic aspects of this pathway using a fibroblast cell line that overexpresses human insulin receptors as a model. This model and other similar ones have been used in our laboratory and others to examine specific aspects of insulin receptor function, such as receptor phosphorylation and traffic [23, 31–33] and the regulation of the MAPK pathway [34].Our studies showed that insulin promoted the translocation of myc-tagged ARNO constructs to the plasma membrane. This result is in agreement with data previously published by Venkateswarlu et al [7] and Langille et al [35] who demonstrated the insulin-dependent translocation of ARNO and the related protein GRP-1 to the plasma membrane, respectively. A detailed analysis of ARNO deletion and point mutants demonstrated that: 1) the translocation of ARNO to the membrane is independent of its ARF-GEF activity; 2) ARNO translocation to the plasma membrane requires an intact PH domain; 3) the CC domain of ARNO plays a role in targeting ARNO to the plasma membrane; 4) neither the PH domain of ARNO nor its CC domain alone sufice to target the protein to the plasma membrane; and 5) the plasma membrane translocation of ARNO is strongly regulated by insulin and, perhaps, other extracellular agonists.The linkage between ARNO translocation to specific subcellular fractions and ARF activation was studied using myc-tagged ARNO and ARF-GFP constructs in two different cell types. Our data showed conclusively that insulin promoted the co-localization of wild type myc-ARNO and ARF1-GFP on the surface of HIRcB and HeLa cells. Interestingly, insulin, acting through ARNO, promoted the translocation of ARF1-GFP to the plasma membrane. ARF1, like most members of the ARF family, is primarily a cytosolic protein that exerts its function on specific membranes to which it is recruited by specific activators that promote the binding of GTP. However, ARF1 seems to act primarily at the Golgi, promoting the binding of coatomer proteins to the Golgi membrane [36, 37]. Nevertheless, the fact remains that ARF1 is primarily cytosolic, and that only a small fraction of it is bound to the Golgi membrane at any time [36]. It is not surprising, therefore, that some ARF1 may bind to the plasma membrane after being locally activated by ARNO, which is in turn recruited to the cell surface by the action of insulin. It should be remembered that our cells overexpress ARF1-GFP. Whether ARF1 does in fact work at the plasma membrane under physiological conditions or not remains to be established. Our data simply establish the fact that a receptor-dependent mechanism to recruit ARF1 to the plasma membrane does exist.

Internal quality control was carried out inserting two fortified samples into each analytical batch (positive controls); a daily matrix-matched curve was prepared for quantification purposes.4.5. Analysis of Commercial CheesesNineteen ewe, four goat and thirteen cow cheeses from various Italian regions and at different ripening stages were collected in local markets and analyzed to determine the contents of HT, T and some of their phase II metabolites. Moisture percentage was calculated from mass difference before and after 24 h of drying at 60 °C. Details about the collected cheeses are in Table S4. Cheese classification was based on rheological properties [46].4.6. Statistical AnalysesPolyphenol concentrations measured on commercial cheeses were not normally distributed (Shapiro–Wilk test) and differences among the three cheese types were analyzed by means of Kruskal–Wallis test followed by post hoc Dunn’s test. Spearman’s correlation was applied to assess the relationships among the measured parameters. Statistical analysis was performed by Stata package, version 16.1 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX, USA).5. ConclusionsLevels of T, HT and their sulfate metabolites were measured in ewe, goat and cow cheeses produced in various Italian regions and at different stages of ripening. Ewe cheese showed higher contents of HT sulfate metabolites (HT-3-S and HT-4-S) as well as of polyphenol sum with respect to cow cheese. Polyphenol concentrations in goat cheese were not significantly different from those in the other two cheese types, but the small sample size may require further studies. In light of these findings, cheese cannot be considered a dietary source of these valuable polyphenols because HT and T health-promoting effects are observed with a daily intake in the order of milligrams and cheese portion size can ensure only a few micrograms per day.

{"input": "cells that had been stably transfected with an ARF1-GFP construct [25]. These cells were transfected with myc-ARNO, serum-starved overnight, and imaged with a confocal microscope equipped with a constant-temperature microperfusion incubator to maintain the temperature at 37°C. Time-lapse images were collected at 30-second intervals. A representative experiment was shown in Fig. 3A. Prior to insulin stimulation, ARF1-GFP protein was mostly cytosolic or bound to the Golgi apparatus, although a small amount of ARF-GFP was localized on the surface of the cells. Ten minutes after the insulin stimulation, most of the ARF1-GFP was found on the plasma membrane. Similar results were obtained with HIRcB cells co-transfected with ARNO-myc and ARF1-GFP (Fig. 3B). It should be noted that a significant accumulation of ARF1-GFP on the plasma membrane was not observed in the cells that had not been transfected with ARNO (not shown), or that had been transfected with the inactive mutant E156K-ARNO (Fig. 3B). Since the endogenous levels of ARNO in HeLa cells were so low that the protein could not be detected in Western blots, it is reasonable to assume that under physiological conditions only a very small fraction of ARF1 translocates to the plasma membrane in response to extracellular agonists.Figure 3A. Real time image of the translocation of ARF1-GFP to the plasma membrane. HeLa cells that had been stably transfected with ARF1-GFP were transiently transfected with myc-ARNO, serum starved overnight, and treated with 100 nM insulin. Images were collected every 30 seconds using a Molecular Dynamics 2001 confocal microscope. The time intervals that were indicated on the upper right hand corner of each panel represent the time after the addition of insulin. B. The translocation of ARF1-GFP to the plasma membrane by the effects of insulin requires ARNO. ARF1-GFP/HeLa cells were transfected with myc-ARNO, treated, fixed, and stained for myc-epitope as described in the Materials and Methods section. Images displaying ARF1-GFP (green) and myc-ARNO (red) were merged us ing Adobe Photoshop software.ARNO interacts directly with the insulin receptorOur previous work has shown that the insulin receptor co-immunoprecipitates with ARF in an agonist-dependent manner [23]. Furthermore, we have also shown that an ARF-GEF activity is associated with the insulin receptor and that this activity is not a function of the receptor itself [23]. Given that many receptor tyrosine kinases form complexes with their target proteins, we tested the hypothesis that ARNO binds the insulin receptor.Figure 4 shows that insulin receptors that were immunoprecipitated in the presence of insulin were associated with an ARF-GEF activity (Fig 4 ●), and that the ARF-GEF activity that was co-immunoprecipitated with the insulin receptor was significantly increased in the cells that had been transiently transfected with myc-ARNO (Fig. 4 ■). Insulin receptors that were immunoprecipitated in the absence of insulin did not accelerate the binding of GTPγS to the recombinant ARF1 as much as those obtained in the presence of insulin (Fig. 4 ○), indicating that the association of ARF-GEF activity with the insulin receptor was dependent on the presence of insulin.Figure 4The ARF-GDP exchange activity", "output": [], "instruction": "I want you extract semantic triples using the following predicates (the definition for each predicate has been defined in the corresponding parentheses):\n\n                                            1) Environmental processes (A series of events that occur naturally in the environment and not within an organism)\n                                            2) Biological processes (Biological or chemical events or a series thereof, leading to a known function or end-product within an organism)\n                                            3) Industrial processes (A series of molecular events that involve at least one synthetic reaction)\n                                            4) Adverse biological roles (The biological function of a chemical that results in harmful effect for an organism.

After shaking and centrifugation (4000 rpm, 10 min), the supernatant was transferred to −80 °C (30 min) for water freezing and then centrifuged (12,000 rpm at 0 °C, 10 min) and evaporated under nitrogen stream. In the meantime, the residual cheese was submitted to a second extraction with 3 mL of the same mixture and the supernatant freeze at −80 °C (30 min), and was then centrifuged and added to the previous supernatant portion for evaporation. After the dissolution of dry residue in 1 mL of ammonium acetate 100 mM (pH = 4), the sample was centrifuged (12,000 rpm at 0 °C, 10 min) and injected into the LC-Q-Orbitrap system. If necessary, an aliquot was diluted tenfold to quantify incurred polyphenols outside the working range.4.3. LC-MS ConditionsChromatographic separation was performed on a Thermo Ultimate 3000 High Performance Liquid Chromatography system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA). The analyte separation was carried out on a Acquity BEH C18 (2.1 × 150 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA) equipped with an Acquity guard column (2.1 × 5 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters, Milford, MA, USA). The flow rate and injection volume were 0.25 mL/min and 5 µL, respectively. Mobile phases were MeOH (A) and water with 2 mM ammonium acetate (B). LC gradient is reported in Table S2. The run time was 22 min. The Q-Orbitrap mass analyser (Q-Exactive Plus, Thermo Scientific, San Jose, CA, USA) was equipped with heated electrospray ionization source (HESI-II). The acquisition was carried out in ESI-negative ionization mode performing full MS/dd-MS2 experiments. Optimized temperature of the source was 320 °C; capillary temperature was 280 °C; and the electrospray voltage was set at 2.5 kV. Sheath and auxiliary gases were set at 50 and 20 arbitrary units. Mass spectrometer was controlled using Excalibur 3.0 software and exact m/z of the compounds was determined using the Qualbrowser 2.0.3 tool of the software. The monitored precursor and fragment ions are detailed in Table S3.4.4. Validation ProcedureThe developed method was validated according to Eurachem Guide [45]. Method linearity was evaluated in the range 0.5–1000 ng mL−1 by means of matrix-matched curves. Precision (repeatability, CVr; within-laboratory reproducibility, CVwR), recovery factors, detection limits (LODs) and quantification limits (LOQs) were estimated from the results of a spiking study. Cheese samples were spiked before extraction at four concentrations: 15, 80, 150 and 750 µg kg−1 dw for all the analytes, except for T which was added at concentrations ten-fold higher (150, 800, 1500 and 7500 µg kg−1 dw). Analytical sessions (four replicates) were repeated in three different days varying operator, calibration status of equipment and cheese type. Precision was assessed applying the Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and recovery factors were calculated comparing the peak area found in the spiked samples against the relevant area in the matrix-matched calibration curve.

{"input": "Title: Chromatographic Separation of Phenolic Compounds from Extra Virgin Olive Oil: Development and Validation of a New Method Based on a Biphenyl HPLC Column Abstracts: Three different high performance liquid chromatography columns were accessed for phenolic compounds (PC) separation in the hydrophilic fraction of extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Two fully porous C18 bonded silica phases and one partially porous biphenyl column were used. Biphenyl column allowed for an increase of more than 30% in peak capacity (nc), higher selectivity (α) (1.045), and improved retention (k), with a reduction of 22.1% in the retention time. The higher resolution (Rs) was obtained by using the biphenyl column, with a fair separation of oleuropein aglycone isomers (OAI) and a good identification of caffeic acid (CA). Tyrosol (T), hydroxytyrosol (HT), and dihydroxyphenyl glycol (DHPG) were also well separated and identified. Moreover, the method using a biphenyl column was fully validated according to the requirements for new methods. For all parameters, the method applying the biphenyl column proved to be a reliable, accurate, and robust tool for separation, identification, and quantification of the main PCs in EVOOs. Body: 1. IntroductionExtra virgin olive oil (EVOO), which represents the primary source of fat intake in the Mediterranean diet, is well known for its health benefits, such as the protection of low density lipoprotein particles from oxidative damage, the maintenance of normal blood high density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations, the maintenance of normal blood pressure, and its anti-inflammatory properties, among many others [1]. Phenolic compounds (PC) are among these health-promoters that are present in EVOO [2,3,4,5,6], which were highlighted by the European Food Safety Authority in 2012 with a health claim for virgin olive oil PCs, which contribute to the protection of blood lipids from oxidative stress [7]. Olive oil (OO) PCs are essential quality biomarkers; in particular, hydroxytyrosol (HT), the target of a health claim, which to be valid, requires the presence of a minimum of 5 mg of HT and its derivatives, per 20 g of OO. The health claim specifications prompted the development of new methods for the better identification and quantification of hydrophilic PCs present in EVOO [8,9].Some of the PCs present in EVOO, particularly hydrophilic phenols, are specific from this source [10]. Despite being minor compounds, representing about 2wt % of EVOOs, hydrophilic phenols, such as phenolic acids, phenolic alcohols, hydroxyl-isochromans, flavonoids, secoiridoids, and lignans, play a key role on the EVOO quality and shelf-life, due to their antioxidant activity [10], with a large impact on the final organoleptic characteristics [11,12,13].The main phenolic alcohols that are present in EVOOs are 3,4-dihydroxyphenylethanol, and p-hydroxyphenyl ethanol, also known as HT, and tyrosol (T), respectively (Figure 1) [14]. These compounds result from secoiridoid aglycones hydrolysis, which are derived mainly from oleuropein degradation during EVOO storage [15]. Dihydroxyphenyl glycol (DHPG) and caffeic acid (CA) are present in lower amounts in EVOO, but they are also of particular interest, due to their high antioxidant activities [16,17,18]. The identification and quantification of these individual PCs in EVOO has been", "output": [["caffeic acid", "sources", "extra virgin olive oil"], ["Tyrosol", "sources", "extra virgin olive oil"], ["Hydroxytyrosol", "sources", "extra virgin olive oil"], ["dihydroxyphenyl glycol", "sources", "extra virgin olive oil"], ["Dihydroxyphenyl glycol", "normal biological role", "antioxidant"], ["caffeic acid", "normal biological role", "antioxidant"], ["hydroxytyrosol", "normal biological role", "antioxidant"], ["tyrosol", "normal biological role", "antioxidant"]], "instruction": "I want you extract semantic triples using the following predicates (the definition for each predicate has been defined in the corresponding parentheses):\n\n                                            1) Environmental processes (A series of events that occur naturally in the environment and not within an organism)\n                                            2) Biological processes (Biological or chemical events or a series thereof, leading to a known function or end-product within an organism)\n                                            3) Industrial processes (A series of molecular events that involve at least one synthetic reaction)\n                                            4) Adverse biological roles (The biological function of a chemical that results in harmful effect for an organism.

Gradual heating and relatively low maximum temperature were chosen to minimize potential discomfort (some patients with CRPS are unable to tolerate higher temperatures due to heat allodynia). Following heating, the pad was removed and a series of scans commenced. Scans continued until the flux levels returned to baseline. In all patients, four series of scans were collected in random order (but each series of scans always alternated from one limb to the other)âred and green laser scans for the affected limb and equivalent contralateral site. The sameÂ procedure was carried out for control subjects, with both right and left limbs (either upper or lower) being studied. Flux images were analyzed (Moor LDI v3.08, Moor Instruments Ltd.) by taking the median blood flow (arbitrary perfusion units) of theÂ heated area; the outline of the area selected was fitted to the dots marked on the skin. Two parameters were calculated: Fluxmax the maximum flux level AUC20 the area under the flux curve for the first 20 scans. Scan series that were too short (due to a rapid return to baseline flux levels) were extended utilizing the flux level from the baseline scan. Both parameters were expressed as a percentage change from baseline. To allow multiple comparisons, statistical analysis was carried out using repeatedâmeasures analysis of variants ([ANOVA]; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). Results Patients and controls tolerated the procedure well with the exception of some mild heatâinduced allodynia in two patients.

The immunoprecipitates were washed with lysis buffer, resuspended in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, and subjected to Western blotting analysis.ImmunoblottingProteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and blocked with 5% non-fat milk in PBS containing 0.1% Tween at room temperature for 2 hrs. The membrane was then cut in half horizontally. The upper part was used to detect the β subunit of the insulin receptor with a monoclonal antibody, CT-1, that recognizes the carboxyl terminus of the β subunit of the human insulin receptor. The lower part was used to detect ARNO proteins with a monoclonal antibody anti-myc or a polyclonal antibody anti-GFP.PLD activity assaySerum-starved HIRcB cells were labeled overnight with 3H-palmitate (5 μCi/ml) in serum-free medium. The cells were stimulated with insulin (100 nM) in the presence of 0.5–1% ethanol for 20 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of chloroform: methanol (1:1). The lipid phase was extracted and developed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel 60 plates using ethyl acetate: trimethylpentane: acetic acid (9: 5: 2) as a solvent. The position of major phospholipids was determined using true standards (Avanti Biochemicals) and autoradiography. The TLC plates were scraped and the total amount of radioactivity associated with each lipid species was determined by liquid scintillation counting. The data were expressed as the number of counts associated with the phosphatidylethanol (PtdEtOH) spot normalized by the total number of counts of lipid.Digitonin treatmentSerum-starved HIRcB cells were collected, resuspended in PBS, and treated with 10 μM digitonin in the presence or absence of insulin (100 nM), ATP (1 mM), and GTPγS (100 μM) at 37°C for 15 min. To release intracellular proteins, the digitonin-treated cells were centrifuged in a microcentrifuge for 20 min. The supernatants and the cell pellets were collected separately, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. ARNO proteins were detected by immunoblotting as described", "output": [], "instruction": "I want you extract semantic triples using the following predicates (the definition for each predicate has been defined in the corresponding parentheses):\n\n                                            1) Environmental processes (A series of events that occur naturally in the environment and not within an organism)\n                                            2) Biological processes (Biological or chemical events or a series thereof, leading to a known function or end-product within an organism)\n                                            3) Industrial processes (A series of molecular events that involve at least one synthetic reaction)\n                                            4) Adverse biological roles (The biological function of a chemical that results in harmful effect for an organism.

{"input": "between different anatomical sites by comparing bilateral sites within patients. Our study has confirmed the feasibility of LDI for studying microvascular pathophysiology in CRPS, but highlights the need for larger, multicenter studies, allowing subgroup analysis. Patients with âhotâ and âcoldâ limbs likely behave very differently and it is probable that the mechanism for âcoldâ and âhotâ CRPS differs. Both classifications of patients were included since it was of interest to see whether âhotâ and âcoldâ limbed patients had the same response to the heating protocol. Clinical features vary considerably over time, given the large duration differences between patients in this study, it is possible that some patients were in an acute phase, others in a chronic phase. Ideally prospective longitudinal studies are required to examine change over time. LDI has been previously applied in only a small number of CRPS studies; to monitor axon flare response to repetitive noxious electrical stimuli, with contrasting results (increased perfusion in patients compared to healthy controls 14 and no difference 12), and to identify abnormal perfusion in patients with recurrent postoperative CRPS 1. Future Therapeutic Strategies Resolving the contribution of local blood flow impairment, leading to tissue hypoxia and freeâradical mediated injury, in CRPS pathogenesis, may identify new therapeutic strategies. Evidence suggests that vitamin C, an antioxidant, may prevent CRPS 15, and free radical scavengers may be effective in treatment 4. The phosphodiesterase inhibitor tadalafil (a vasodilator) reduced pain in âcoldâ CRPS 6 although conversely topically applied isosorbide dinitrate (a nitric oxide donor) did not confer benefit 7. Perspective In conclusion, we did not find impaired vasodilation in patients with CRPS, although the small patient numbers and heterogeneity of the disease (âhotâ and âcold,â upper and lower limb involvement) limit our conclusions. Larger studies would allow subanalysis of upper and lower limb and the differences between âhotâ and âcoldâ CRPS to further understanding. Vasomotor changes in CRPS may relate to large vessel dysfunction, or occur primarily in subgroups of patients not well represented in this small study.

{"input": "It is likely that all contribute either as initiators or perpetuators of the âvicious cycleâ of CRPS, and that all interârelate. Current treatments are often unsatisfactory, highlighting the importance of increasing our understanding of the underlying disease mechanisms in order to inform new directions in therapy. Vasomotor changes are well recognized in CRPS, with color or temperature changes in the affected extremity. In the most characteristic case, the affected limb is initially warm and red, becoming mottled and intermittently warm and cool before becoming more permanently cold. However, some patients report coldness of the affected limb from the outset. It remains unknown whether these vasomotor changes relate to abnormalities of the cutaneous microvasculature at the affected site. This is a relatively underâresearched area, although different investigators have reported microvascular dysfunction 13, and affected limbs have been shown to be hypoxic 8. It has been suggested that an imbalance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation occurs 3. The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that microvascular dysfunction occurs in the skin of patients with CRPS. If so, then treatments targeting microvascular pathology might be beneficial. Specifically, we sought to identify whether there were differences in either deeper cutaneous blood vessels (as measured by red LDI) or the more superficial nutritive vessels (as measured by green LDI), as discussed previously, 10 between the affected and unaffected limb in patients with CRPS, and between CRPS patients and healthy control subjects. Local heating was chosen as the most suitable physiological stimulus. Patients and Methods Twentyâtwo patients with CRPS (five male) and 23 healthy control subjects (one male) were recruited. The mean age of patients was 45 (range 20â77) years and of control subjects 43 (24â70) years. Mean disease duration was four (range 0.25â14) years. Six patients and one control were smokers. Thermography of patients was carried out prior to the laser Doppler protocol. Classification was based upon thermography and patient description. Six patients described their affected limb as predominantly âhotâ and 14 as predominantly âcoldâ (although only one had an unequivocally âhotâ limb as judged by clinical examination and thermography). Fourteen patients had lower limb involvement and eight had upper limb. All subjects gave written informed consent. The study had the approval of the Salford and Trafford Local Research Ethics Committee. Subjects were acclimatized for 20Â minutes in a temperatureâcontrolled room at 23Â Â±Â 1Â°C. For patients with upper limb CRPS, the dorsum of the hand was preferentially examined and for patients with lower limb CRPS, the medial border of the calf. These sites were chosen to allow logistically easy imaging and minimize discomfort to the patient. The same sites were used in the control subjects. In all cases, the bilateral position was used as an internal control. Scans were carried out using dual wavelength LDI (red (633Â nm) and green 532Â nm 10; Moor Instruments Ltd., Axminster, UK and Laser Quantum, Manchester, UK). A baseline scan was taken.
